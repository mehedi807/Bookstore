# Bookstore - A MERN Stack Web Application

**Bookstore**, a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This is my first MERN project, and it serves as a simple yet functional bookstore management system.

## Features

- **Create Books**: Add new books to the bookstore with details like title, author, description, and price.
- **Read Books**: View a list of all available books in the bookstore.
- **Update Books**: Edit the details of existing books.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the bookstore.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Styling**: CSS (or any library/framework you used, e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux (if used)
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman (for API testing)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

         npm install
         npm run dev
      ```
   
      >. Start the frontend server:

         cd ../frontend
         npm install
